This is the react version of Zookies Dookies. This app features the following technologies:

- Flask
- Flask Login
- React
- Axios
- React Data Table Components
- Material UI
- Styled Components

This app allows the user to log in and/or create an account. Then they can add a dog to their list, and then track some of the medical information for their dog. This will also include the dog's poops!

## Problems I Ran Into

- Too much time spent on data structure
- started react native, didn't have time enough for that
- Too many routes to add into react
- got caught on a lot of small problems
- decided to focus on material ui too late

## Future Features

- Ability to add defaults to poop details
- Upload pictures
- Update dookies, meds, vaccines (and dog)
- Make the show dogs button instead show a random dog and a set number
- Update mobile responsiveness
